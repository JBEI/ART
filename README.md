# Automated Recommendation Tool (ART)

ART is a tool that leverages machine learning and probabilistic modeling techniques to guide metabolic engineering in a systematic fashion, without the need for a full mechanistic understanding of the biological system. Using sampling-based optimization, ART provides a set of recommended strains to be built in the next engineering cycle in order to achieve the given objective, alongside probabilistic predictions of their production levels.

Please note that this repository does not contain ART source code. For information on how to access the library see the [License](#license) section.

## System Requirements

### Hardware requirements

The `ART` package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory
operations. While slimmer installs may be possible, at the time of writing, ART developers
typically dedicate 8GB RAM and 80GB of disk to the Docker Desktop instance used to develop and
test the code on MacOS.

ART requires a minimum of 2 physical processor cores to run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling. For more complex problems, ART's results will improve on systems with many processor
cores to dedicate to MCMC sampling (see the `max_mcmc_cores` parameter).

### Software requirements

#### OS Requirements

The ART Docker image will run on any OS that Docker supports (e.g. macOS, Linux, Windows).

Direct install of ART into your system Python is not the recommended or supported
workflow. Please use the included Docker image for reproducible builds, and as a reference for any
direct installs you attempt on your own. While there are valid reasons to use ART externally to
the included Docker image, unfortunately the ART team is not resourced to support
non-Docker workflows.

In the past, direct installs of ART had been tested on _macOS_ and _Linux_:

-   macOS: Mojave (10.14.1), Catalina (10.15.1)
-   Linux: Debian 9 & 10

#### Docker

Docker is the preferred / supported environment for running ART. Docker creates reproducible
runs in a tested runtime environment. Docker also avoids the installation headaches and potential
pitfalls of directly installing ART into your system Python.

## Examples

An example is provided in the [`Limonene_Example.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JBEI/ART/blob/master/Limonene_Example.html) file.
Generating this output in a jupyter notebook should take ~5 mins on a MacBook Pro, CPU: 3.5GHz Intel Core i7, RAM: 16GB (2133MHz LPDDR3).

Additional tutorials, including real and simulated data sets, are provided in the [`notebooks`](https://github.com/JBEI/ART/tree/master/notebooks) directory.
