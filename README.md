# Automated Recommendation Tool (ART)

ART is a tool that leverages machine learning and probabilistic modeling techniques to guide metabolic engineering in a systematic fashion, without the need for a full mechanistic understanding of the biological system. Using sampling-based optimization, ART provides a set of recommended strains to be built in the next engineering cycle in order to achieve the given objective, alongside probabilistic predictions of their production levels.

Please note that this repository does not contain ART source code. For information on how to access the library see the [License](#license) section.

## System Requirements

### Hardware requirements
`ART` package requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations.

### Software requirements
#### OS Requirements
This package is supported for *macOS* and *Linux*. The package has been tested on the following systems:
+ macOS: Mojave (10.14.1), Catalina (10.15.1)
+ Linux: Debian 9

## Examples

An example is provided in the [`Limonene_Example.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JBEI/ART/blob/master/Limonene_Example.html) file.
Generating this output in a jupyter notebook should take ~5 mins on a MacBook Pro, CPU: 3.5GHz Intel Core i7, RAM: 16GB (2133MHz LPDDR3).

Additional tutorials, including real and simulated data sets, are provided in the [`notebooks`](https://github.com/JBEI/ART/tree/master/notebooks) directory.
